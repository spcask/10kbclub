<h1>10 KB Club</h1>
<p>
The <em>10 KB Club</em> is a curated collection of <em>interesting</em>
websites whose home pages do not exceed 10 KB compressed size. Whether a
website is interesting enough to be a member of this club is decided
based on the criteria specified in the <a href="#club-rules">Club
Rules</a> section.
</p>

<h2 id="club-members">Club Members<a href="#club-members"></a></h2>
<p>
The following websites are members of the 10 KB Club. The data in the
table below was fetched on Thu, 24 Dec 2020 10:28:23 GMT. This data is
refreshed at least once a day. To suggest a new website to be added to
here, see the <a href="#new-membership">New Membership</a> section.

<p>
Do not take the content size and content ratio columns too seriously.
The content size is calculated using <a
href="https://github.com/susam/10kbclub/blob/master/refresh.js">refresh.js</a>
in the source code of the repository. It is not always accurate. For
example, it considers internal CSS to be content but external CSS to be
not content. Therefore, home pages that use CSS within an HTML page have
an unfair advantage to get a higher content ratio than it should. <a
href="https://250kb.club/">250 KB Club</a> too suffers from the same
issue.
</p>

<h2 id="club-rules">Club Rules<a href="#club-rules"></a></h2>
<p>
Each website that is a member of the 10 KB Club is identified by a URL
to its home page. The URL must satisfy the following rules:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the URL is opened in a web browser with no ad blockers or
      script blockers enabled, the compressed data that the web browser
      has to fetch to load the complete web page must not exceed 10240
      bytes. To check this on Firefox or Chrome, open a new
      private/incognito window, then right click on the blank page and
      select "Inspect", then go to the "Network" tab, and finally enter
      the URL in the address bar and press enter. The transferred size
      appears in the status bar at the bottom of the network tab.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The URL must point to a home page of the website. This is usually
      the root directory of the domain, i.e., of the form <a
      href="https://www.example.com/">https://www.example.com/</a> but
      it need not always be so. An URL of the form <a
      href="https://www.example.com/alice/">https://www.example.com/alice/</a>
      is also okay as long as it is a home page of some website that
      exists under that directory, i.e., a top-level user page within a
      domain is considered as a website home page.
    <p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The URL must point to a page that contains useful content (e.g.,
      an article, a manifesto page, etc.) or a list of links to such
      content (e.g., blog listing, catalog of websites, etc.), or
      provides useful functionality (e.g., a web-based game, an online
      currency convertor, etc.).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The URL must not point merely to a page with metadata about a
      person or an organization (e.g., welcome page, about page, contact
      information page, etc. without any other content are not okay).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Some content from the website must have received at least 100
      points on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
      on at least one occasion. Use the following URL to check
      submissions for a website on Hacker News and the votes each
      submission has received: <a
      href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=example.com">https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=example.com</a>
      (replace "example.com" with the domain of the website).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that the steps provided for Firefox and Chrome in the 1st point do
not constitute a definitive decision criteria for membership. The final
decision on whether the compressed transfer size is done by <a
href="https://github.com/susam/10kbclub/blob/master/refresh.js">refresh.js</a>
in the source code of this website. It does not always exactly match
what Firefox or Chrome shows. For example, this script does not count
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a> transfer
size, so the transfer size that this script determines is usually a
little less than what Firefox or Chrome shows.
</p>
<p>
If a website's domain name or URL changed since one of its links
received 100 or more points on Hacker News, as long as we can prove that
the URL being submitted is indeed the same website from which some
content received at least 100 points on Hacker News, it is elligible to
be a member of this club.
</p>
<p>
If you think that there is a very useful website that does not satisfy
the 4th point but is still noteworthy enough to be a part of this list,
please go ahead and propose it for addition by following the <a
href="#new-membership">next section</a>. We will decide whether to add
such websites on a case by case basis.
</p>

<h2 id="new-membership">New Membership<a href="#new-membership"></a></h2>
<p>
To add a new member website to this club, first ensure that it satisfies
the rules laid out in the <a href="#club-rules">Club Rules</a> section.
If it satisfies the club rules, then <a
href="https://github.com/susam/10kbclub/issues/new">create a new issue
on GitHub</a> and provide the URL of the website.
